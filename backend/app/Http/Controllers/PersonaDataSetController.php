                        "HR loves a good policy. 

                            Like it or not, it's a part of life. But policies aren't the answer to everything. 
                            
                            In this fun snippet I created based on the style of the \"If you Give a Mouse a Cookie\" books, I walk through what might be on an HR pro's mind as they think about that policy creation and everything that goes before (and comes after). üòÅ üòÅ üòÅ 
                            
                            If you give HR policy, they'll make a handbook with it. 
                            
                            And making the handbook reminds them that they really need to do a training. 
                            
                            While they're thinking about that training and preparing for it, they'll remember that they have a new onboarding class to teach. 
                            
                            And as they're getting ready for the onboarding class, they'll remember that they need to post a new job requisition. 
                            
                            As they're posting the job requisition, they'll realize that they still need to update some of those job descriptions that have been lingering out there for a while. 
                            
                            And while the job description updates are currently in progress, HR will remember that they needed to look at some of the ranges for compensation to confirm pay equity and market competitiveness. 
                            
                            And as competition is on their mind, they'll wonder about their employer value proposition. 
                            
                            So they'll set a meeting with leadership to talk about their EVP and their culture and their values that they want to use to attract the right candidates. 
                            
                            And while talking to leadership, HR will remember that they have to do an update on HR metrics for the leadership team presentation. 
                            
                            While collecting those metrics, they'll wonder about what's happening with turnover and what's really driving employee retention. 
                            
                            And those thoughts make them think about the importance of managers and how they develop them to be capable leaders who are compliant with legal requirements. 
                            
                            And when they start to think about legal requirements, they'll think about policies and they'll wonder if they need a new one.

                        "I was in a very thoughtful discussion last week with some experts on AI, legislation, and the administration's perspective on technology advancement. 
                            
                            One of the hot news items since January has been the new Trump administration's series of Executive Orders. I'd like to touch on the EO titled: REMOVING BARRIERS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. 
                            
                            President Trump is a business and free market guy--always has been, always will be. Therefore it make sense that his approach to AI advancement will rely more heavily on business and industry to make this work. I'm a free market guy, too, but my enthusiasm in this area is tempered by a few important examples. 
                            
                            For starters, the history of deregulation in the US absolutely HAS created more innovation and competition, which are the stated goals of any deregulation. üíØ
                            
                            However, we also see unintended consequences. üëé 
                            
                            Some businesses fail. Consumers may end up with worse experiences in some cases (think of the old air travel you see in the movies with full meals and personalized service back a few decades and the cramped experiences most people have today crammed into that narrow metal tube hurtling through the sky). 
                            
                            Deregulation in airlines led to new low cost carriers and more competition, but also to the experience outlined above. 
                            
                            Deregulation in energy led to more control and choice, but also rolling blackouts in California and the Enron-driven market price fixing/gouging. 
                            
                            We're assuming AI companies will be honest, truthful, and forthright. And again, while I believe in and love capitalism, we need some checks and balances, because the AI companies are ALREADY doing shady things & making million$ from it.
                            
                            Take this example. Let's say you're an artist that designs unique cartoons. AI companies are consuming your content to train their models, & anyone can create a cheap AI knockoff of your designs for virtually nothing. Want to try to sue the company to stop them? Good luck. They have virtually unlimited funds because they are actively selling what they have stolen from you. 
                            
                            ‚è© You can't catch up. 
                            
                            This is fundamentally different from a previous time in history where theft was happening at a massive scale. Anyone else remember Napster, Kazaa, and the MP3 download generation? üé∂ 
                            
                            In that case, the bigger companies were the ones being wronged since they owned the rights, and they had the money to fight to get their content protected. 
                            
                            So who's protecting the artists, writers, musicians, and other creators? 
                            
                            That's just one example, but it shows that if these companies are already taking the content and ideas of others to train their models, we shouldn't assume they will be honest and fair in their future development, either. 
                            
                            The answer? Well, we need that right balance of government support+advocacy w/enough oversight to make sure these AI companies are creating what will empower and support the population, not weaken it. 
                            
                            Still working out how to balance that one. üôÉ

                            As I'm updating the book on AI, I am changing a lot of names and content.

                            Joonko started as an AI tool that was supposed to help employers access diverse talent. The AI would capture the \"silver medalists\" that employers didn't hire and put them into a pool so that diversity-conscious employers could tap into that group of candidates as a collective. Ultimately, it would mean more opportunities for diverse candidates to be seen by recruiters, increasing their chances of being hired. 
                            
                            Neat idea, and one that I supported with a mention in the first edition of the book. 
                            
                            Too bad it was pretty much all a sham. 
                            
                            From the Justice Department brief (any RAZ comments are referring to the CEO, Ilit Raz):
                            --------------------------------------------------
                            Joonko was a company that purported to offer an artificial intelligence-based product designed to help prospective employers identify and hire job candidates from diverse backgrounds. ...

                            Should this scare us away from any company claiming to use AI? Certainly not. It's more of a cautionary tale to investors, but the lesson we can learn from this is pretty clear: 
                            
                            When evaluating #HRtechnology, any vendors that claim \"AI secret sauce\" as a justification simply won't work.
